## ⭐️ Overview

**Nōma - s a conceptual restaurant webpage celebrating the spirit of New Nordic cuisine—seasonal, foraged, fermented, and quietly radical. Picture a serene dining room tucked along Copenhagen’s harbor, where the menu shifts with the tides and the moss on your plate might be more than décor.**
**A part of the curriculum on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)**

This project was created to demonstrate:

- Modular JavaScript with ES6 imports/exports\
- Asset management and bundling using Webpack\
- Clean component-based structure for pages (Home, Menu, and About)\
- Styling with minimalist, nature-driven aesthetics—custom fonts, subtle micro-animations, and season-based theming inspired by Nordic design
